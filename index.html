  <p>Highly motivated, hard-working individual that believes<br>
      with the right attitude, anything is possible. I strongly think that<br>
      pushing yourself out of your comfort zone is how you evolve into a better person.</p>
    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <h3>Customer Service Associate: 2016-Present</h3>
    <h4>Walmart</h4>
    <p>Towards the beginning of November, I have been working as a Walmart Associate.<br>
      My duties include answering the store phone, running the fitting rooms, and helping customers<br>
      with any questions they have. A lot of people have low expectations when they come into Walmart, <br>
      and for that reason I like to go above and beyond to satisfy the customer.</p>
    <h3>Lacrosse Official: 2011-2016</h3>
    <h4>Upper Midwest Lacrosse Officials Association</h4>
    <p>Since I was a freshman in high school I have been working as a year-round lacrosse official.<br>
      I work with kids ages 8-18. In order to be a good official you have to control the game. <br>
      I learned from years of dealing with emotional parents and players, how to handle situations like that professionally.<br>
      No matter what the sitaution, if you handle it professinally things will go a lot more smoothly.</p>
    <h3>Painter/Business Owner: June-July 2016</h3>
    <h4>MN Pro Painting</h4>
      <p>Last summer a buddy and I started our own painting company. We started door-to-door <br>
        handing out flyers with nothing but the painting supply’s we found in our garages. <br>
        We eventually got enough money to get our own quality gear, start sending out mail orders,<br> 
        and even got ourselves a work truck! We started out with nothing and we were able to make something. <br>
        It’s one of the things I am most proud of.</p>
